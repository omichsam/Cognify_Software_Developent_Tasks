# 🧠 Cognify Python Mini Projects Suite

Welcome to the Python Mini Projects Suite! This repository contains six beginner-to-intermediate level Python projects to help you master core programming concepts such as loops, functions, CRUD operations, file I/O, and web scraping. Each task is self-contained and demonstrates a specific area of learning.

## ⚙️ Requirements

Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed. Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

##  How to Run the Projects

E.g 
Task 1: Simple Number Patterns
Generates number pyramids using loops.

``` bash
 python number_patterns.py
 ```


## Future-Proofing the Project
To upgrade these projects for real-world or enterprise-grade scenarios:

- ✅ Add Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) with Tkinter or PyQt

-  ✅ Integrate databases like SQLite or PostgreSQL for task persistence

-   ✅ Implement authentication in CRUD apps for multi-user access

-  ✅ Use Selenium/Playwright for scraping dynamic JavaScript-heavy sites

-  ✅ Build REST APIs for CRUD apps using Flask or FastAPI

-  ✅ Host web-based scrapers and dashboards using Streamlit or Dash

-  ✅ Respect robots.txt and legal boundaries while scraping


## 💡 Skills I Learnt
- Loops & Conditionals

- OOP with Python

- File Input/Output

- Error Handling

- Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup)

- CLI-based UX

- Data Formatting (Rich Library)
